**Audience**
- One-to-one testing via Teams
- 6 potential SME customers (3 tested GlobalScot registration, 3 tested business member registration)
- 5 male, 1 female
- None had ever heard of GlobalScot

**Focus**
- What causes users to drop off during the registration process? 
- Are there any usability issues in the registration process?

**Summary of results**
- Users like the clear, simple design of the site and registration process
- No major showstoppers
- Text about priority countries/sectors on the GlobalScot login page can be off-putting
- There are some inconsistencies in how we indicate which fields are required and which are optional
- It isn't clear that you can choose multiple options from drop-down menus
- There are some inconsistencies in our countries drop-downs
- It isn't clear that you need to click the 'Add company' button on the business member registration to add your company

**Recommendations**
- Ensure that the drop-down lists for 'Which nationality would you describe yourself as?','Which country are you primarily based for work?' and 'Which other countries do you have connections in?' are consistent
- Mark 'Which university or college did you attend?' as optional – it is, but it doesn't say 'Optional'
- Mark 'Your role at company' as required – it is, but there is no asterix
- Add text that says 'Choose as many as you like' to the drop-down fields so users know they can select multiple options
- Change the text on the 'Add company' button to 'Confirm company' or something similar
- Update the text on the GlobalScot login page to make it clear that people outside those sectors/areas are welcome to apply
