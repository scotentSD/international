**Phase**
- Beta

**Date and type**
- Mar 26th 2020,  Skype

**What we tested**
- Looked at design of staff dashboard
- Explored what are the critical needs for staff in this and whether these designs met it
- Looked at user profiles to ascertain if they had all the necessary information

**Who we tested with**
- 4 Staff members

**What we discovered**
Dashboard
- Liked the clear layout
- Liked teh 3 Big Blocks at the top which covered Key CYA's  and KPI's together
- Staff needed to see bad feedback on globalscots.  it was deemed to be essential
- They want to see the dates of last interactions
- They would like less information on the dashboard and a more graphic layout
- Suggested that there is also a section for "Notes". This started a GDPR discussion about what was appropriate to record.

User profile
- Needs space for other company details than just current company

**Changes made**
- Bad feedback now a headline button
- Layout streamlined
- Dates of interactions now in backlog
- Investigate Notes functionality and GDPR implications
