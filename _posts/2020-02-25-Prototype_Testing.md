**Phase**
- Beta

**Date and type**
- 25th Feb 2020, Skype

**What we tested**
- Full walk through of current GlobalScot prototype


**Who we tested with**
- 2 GlobalScots


**What we discovered**
- GlobalScots were very pleased that we had listened to feedback.
- There were several language issues. The two bigs ones were:
   - **Pulse**. This was not understood to be "News"
   - **Challenges**. This was not understood to be "Shared collaboration area"

**Recomendations**
- Revise language around Pulse and Challenges.

**Changes made**
- **Challenges** was dropped
- **Pulse** was split and changed to "Community Feed" & "News and Features"
