**Audience** 
- Three GlobalScots, Two staff, Three companies who have engaged with GlobalScots (GS regions: Scotland, Switzerland, Asia)

**Focus**
- To get feedback on three design options for the GlobalScot website
- To gain insights on the use of networks and forums

**What we discovered**
- Little use of the current website
- No version favoured - all lacked impact
- Mobile version preferred (App)
- Too much text on the homepage and typeface too small
- Map was popular if it was interactive
- Confusion between the 'sign up' and 'join the network' buttons
- Particpants expect info about the network prior to inviitation to join
- Users expect to hover over icons for more information
- Unsure who the site is designed for, so clear signposting required for different audience types
- Worry that network/forum could be used for sales and marketing purposes rather than intented purpose

**What we'll do next**
- Test the wireframes with users who have no experience of the GlobalScot service to get additional insights
