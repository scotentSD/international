**Phase**
- Alpha

**Date and type**
- Dec 17th 2019,  Userzoom

**Audience**
- 15 participants, UK-based, aged 24-70, household income Â£30-80K, either business owner/senior business decision maker/entrepreneur

**We were focusing on**
- Testing the new homepage wireframes

**What the test involved**
- Participants were shown one of three versions of the homepage wireframe (5 participants per wireframe)
- Participants were asked to talk through what they liked and disliked and any general impressions
- Participants were asked to rate how well they understood different parts of the page
- Participants were given a set of statements about the wireframes and asked to select the ones they agreed with
- Participants were asked which links they would have clicked

**What we discovered**
- Users generally had a good understanding that the homepage was for a business networking platform
- Users were not very clear on the difference between joining as a member and joining as a GlobalScot
- Most users would have used the links on the page to find out more ('Find out more before joining' 'Find out more about our GlobalScots' and 'Explore features' were most popular)
- Some users felt the page was too long

**What we'll do next**
- Create a new version of the wireframe that includes all the things people liked best about the original three
- Include any changes based on feedback 
- Test all 4 versions with each participant to get their thoughts on which is their favourite
