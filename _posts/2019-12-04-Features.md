- Dec 4th 2019,  Userzoom

**Audience**
- 25 participants, UK-based, aged 25-70, household income Â£30-80K, either business owner/senior business decision maker/entrepreneur

**We were focusing on**
- Priotising benefits and features of an online business network

**What we discovered**
- Top priorities for an online business network were expanding your network, getting business and development advice from business and industry experts, and digital regisration - entirely self-serve with no need to phone up
- Top features were forums - a space to ask/answer questions and join conversations, groups - sub-sections within a network focused on a specific topic, and direct messaging between members
- Focus on benefits more than features - 75% said they would rather see inforamtion on benefits than features on the homepage
- Make it clear that the service is free 
- About us page could be useful to reassure users who the organiser is
- We may want to consider what we way about the quality of the network (in terms of vetting)
