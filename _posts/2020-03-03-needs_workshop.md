**Phase**
- Alpha

**Date and type**
- Mar 03 2020,  Face to Face & Skype

**Workshop details**
- Develop Story Map of User Needs
- Develop related Story Map for related Features
- Develop mapping demonstrating linkage

**Why**
- This gives a super simple view of:
	- Needs and Features
	- How they map to each other
	- How they are prioritised
	- How they are phased for delivery
- And this gives a simple way of viewing everything, understanding priorities and phases, and easily re-prioritising it.
