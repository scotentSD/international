**Phase**
- Beta

**Date and type**
- June 20th 2020,  Userzoom




**Hypothesis**
- The new home page navigation bar will be easy to use and surface pages that are lower in teh site Hierarchy.

**We tested with**
- With 10 people from the generic UserZoom panel
- This was a generic online unmoderated test

**What the test involved**
- They were asked to look at the homepage and sub pages to give comment. 
This would force them to use the navigation bar, without us specifically mentioning it.
 

**What we discovered**
- The Hypothesis was supported
- The homepage was well received with comments around it being clean, having clean design, uncluttered layout, nice photography and clear fonts.
- The home page “navigation bar” worked seamlessly for all users. 
- The actual homepage was viewed favorably. 
Other observations- 
- Some people thought the home page was too long
- Some people viewed the images as stock photography and a bit fake. 
- Some people said the hero banner was too large and they would rather have seen useful content sooner on the page.  
- One user said the site looked like LinkedIn and had seen nothing to suggest that this was more useful. 


**What we'll do next**
- Adopt this navigation bar
- Review the nagative feedback with regards to:  
   - Images
   - Page Length
   - Hero Banner size
