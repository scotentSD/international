**Phase**
- Pre-alpha

**Scot Export Event**
- Nov 12th 2019,  at the Glasgow Technology Innovation Centre

**Audience**
- Circa 350 Exporters or people looking to export

**We were focusing on**
- Globalscot awareness
- Globalscot past experiences
- Globalscot sentiment

**What we discovered**
- People have a reasonably high awareness of GlobalScot (in this audience)
- They are not always accurate in what they think GlobalScot is
- They often hear about GlobalScot through existing SDI interactions
- Actual usage levels are quite low
- People find it takes a long time to access
  - QUOTE: "**It is a very manual process**"
- People only use the website when they want to use the network. (Earlier access might have prepared them better)
- The web site appears dated
  - QUOTE: "**It looks like a 10 year old website**"
