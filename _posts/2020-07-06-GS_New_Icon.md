**Phase**
- Beta

**Date and type**
- July 6th 2020,  UserZoom

**Audience**
- Generic online usability testing
- Unmoderated online testing using the UserZoom platform
- UserZoom online tested it with 10 un-screened people from their generic panel.
- This was a raw usability test to see if a normal person would notice the GlobalScot Icon and understand it’s significance
- 7 Male. 3 Female. (Randomised selection) 

**Hypthesis**
- Making the GlobalScot Icon more obvious will increase the recognition of both GlobalScots, (as GlobalScots), and normal members as not being GlobalScots.
- The Hypothesis was supported. 

**What the test involved**
- We asked the participants to login and go to the Members Page. 
- We asked them to identify 3 people who were NOT GlobalScots
- This entailed them successfully clicking the “ALL” option on the members page and then noticing and understanding the significance of the GlobalScot icon, on the cards that are displayed in the listings. 

**What we discovered**
- The Icon is universally understood by users. 
- It succesfully identified GlobalScots
- It succesfully identified the opposite, "Who was not a GlobalScot", by exception.
- It was fast and easy to understand

**What we'll do next**
- Adopt this new Icon.
