**Phase**
- Beta

**Date and type**
- Jan 01 2020,  Face to Face & Skype

**What we tested**
-


**Who we tested with**

**What the test involved**
-


**What we discovered**
General
- There were too many buttons
- Still not enough information to make an informed decision
- Join implied automatic acceptance
- The join form is too soon and the pop up us perceived to be a barrier

Layout
- The design is too linear with a lot of wasted space at the side
- The design is aimed too much at new members
- Events should be further up the page and we shouldnâ€™t have to join to view
