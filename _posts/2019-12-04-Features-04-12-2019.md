**Phase**
- Alpha

**Date and type**
- Dec 4th 2019,  Userzoom

**Audience**
- 25 participants, UK-based, aged 25-70, household income Â£30-80K, either business owner/senior business decision maker/entrepreneur

**We were focusing on**
- Priotising benefits and features of an online business network

**What the test involved**
- Participants were given a list of benefits of the platform and asked to rank them in order of importance
- Participants were given a list of features of the platform and asked to rank them in order of importance
- Participants were asked if there were any other benefits or features they'd expect to see from a platform like this
- Participants were asked which type of information (benefits or features) they'd be most interested in seeing to help them decide

**What we discovered**
- Top priorities for an online business network were expanding your network, getting business and development advice from business and industry experts, and digital regisration - entirely self-serve with no need to phone up
- Top features were forums - a space to ask/answer questions and join conversations, groups - sub-sections within a network focused on a specific topic, and direct messaging between members
- 75% of users said they would rather see inforamtion on benefits than features on the homepage
- Some users were interested in what costs/charges are involved
- Some users were interested in who is behind the platform (i.e public sector or private sector)
- Some users expected all network members to be vetted to ensure the quality of the network

**What we'll do next**
- Use research to date to create wireframes of the network homepage, based on the information users have told us they'd be most interested in
