**Phase**
- Beta

**Date and type**
- April 28-29 2020,  Skype

**What we tested**
- Search Facility (for a globalscot)
- Starting a chat
- Using Chat (Messaging)
- Accept a request
- Profiles
- Asking a GlobalScot for help

**Who we tested with**
- 2 GlobalScots


**What we discovered**
- Too many buttons for member search its confusing
- Wasnâ€™t clear whether people were GlobalScot or not. Icon too subtle.
- Speach/Text box is still too subtle in the chat
- Member search defaults to All and this diluted the prime function of finding GlobalScots.
- Help Text in "Assk a GlobalScot" form was too vague
- Adding an additional person to a chat was confusing

**Suggestions**
- Make GlobalScot icon more obvious
- Streamline the buttons/filter in Member search
- Switch default filter from ALL to GlobalScots
- Improve Help Text
- Improve "Add person to chat" function. Remove duplicate options to simplify the process.
- Improve success messaging - especially around the SLA and what happens if the GlobalScot has not responded within 3 days.
