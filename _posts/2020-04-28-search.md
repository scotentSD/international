**Phase**
- Beta

**Date and type**
- April 28-29 2020,  Skype

**What we tested**
- Search Facility (for a globalscot)
- Starting a chat
- Using Chat
- Accept a request

**Who we tested with**
- 2 GlobalScots


**What we discovered**
- Too many buttons for member search its confusing
- Wasnâ€™t clear whether people were GlobalScot or not. Icon too subtle.

**Suggestions**
- Make GlobalScot icon more obvious
- Streamline the buttons/filter in Member search
